This is project-01 homework for lede program.  You can find my work in this [website](https://masashiijichi.github.io/lede-project-02-website/doc/lede_project2.index.html).

# Title
What If Aliens Use ChatGPT to Study Earth?ðŸ‘¾

<br>
-Will Earth be Misrepresented?-

# Goal 
To replicate Nikkei's visual contents editting system called "Rich contents builder" while trying new features you cannnot achieve using the system.  

# Finding 
ChatGPT is gender biased about generating images for typical profession and also left leaning when it comes to political questions.
Also it is prone to generate Caucasian examples to show profession.  

# Summary of data collection process
1. Ask quetions to answer and ask to generate images [here](https://chatgpt.com/)
2. Embed Google Trends data about ChatGPT  from this [webseite](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%201-d&q=ChatGPT)
3. Use Emerging Technology Observatory's [dataset](https://eto.tech/dataset-docs/private-sector-ai-indicators/#patents)


# Overview of the data analysis process
1. Generate multiple images with the same conditons
2. Visually categorize the images
3. Use NLP to study ChatGPT responses, I relied entirely on this work from [surajkarak](https://github.com/surajkarak/TANLP_Project/tree/main)
